Brave, strong, bold and wild
Roaring loud his battle cry
Red lion ready to crush
Thirsty for enemies' blood

Flying the flag of the Lion Rampant
Carried to war - Eager to fight
Standing our ground where we'll live and you'll die
Leading the army - The Lion Rampant

Unwilling to agree the terms
Uncaring for the banner of truce
